# Snouztorio

This is a mod pack intended as an extension to Space Age. I'm adding mods with care, according to these guidelines:

- Keep your **save intact** | Restrain from changing vanilla stuff, like adding ingredients to existing recipes, or breaking some mechanics/UI
- Keep the game **balanced** | Nothing cheaty, respect the vanilla progression, don't bypass challenges
- Keep it **simple** | Don't get lost in recipes, avoid redundancy
- Keep it **visually coherent** | I've contributed visually to a number of these mods to make their presentation in line with Factorio
- Keep **challenges fairly unique** | Try to keep some flavor to the challenge, avoid endless variations of base recipes to artificially extend playtime
- Keep a **normal difficulty** | Avoid very hard challenges

--- 

So far, the mod doesn't tweak anything, but I plan to change some costs to accompany Space age more naturally. I aim for it to become more and more coherent and unified, and to carefully add mods that have basically no drawback

I'm very open to **feedback**, **contributions** and **mod suggestions**

Includes Maraxsis and Cerys.
